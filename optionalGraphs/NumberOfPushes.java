	/*
	 * You are currently on a floor "s" of a building, where you see an elevator. Upon entering the elevator, you see that there are only two button "up u" and "down d". The up button takes the elevator "u" floors up(if there aren't enough floors, pressing the up does nothing), while the down button takes the elevator "d" floors down(or none if there aren't enough).
The building has a total of "f" floors and you have to reach floor "g".
You have to find the number of pushes required to reach from floor "s" to "g" as soon as possible. If it is not possible to reach using elevator, return -1.
Input Format:
The input contains a single line having f, s, g, u, d separated by space. (Floors are 1 indexed i.i 5 floors means [1:5])
Output Format:
The output line contains the minimum numbers of pushes that you must make in order to get from "s" to "g" else -1 if it is impossible to reach using the elevator.
Constraints:
1 <= s, g <= f <= 10^6
0 <= u, d <= 10^6
Sample Input :
10 1 8 2 1
Sample Output:
5
