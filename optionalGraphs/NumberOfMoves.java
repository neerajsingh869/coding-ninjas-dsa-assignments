	 * A chessboard is given with n rows and m columns. On that chessboard some of the cells are already occupied. There is queen placed at one of the cell in that chessboard. Queen wants to move to the another cell on that chessboard. You have to find the least possible moves required by the queen. The queen can go any number of cells in any of eight directions in a single move, but it can't pass through or stand on the occupied cells and leave the board.
Input format:
The first line consists of two numbers n and m separated with a space. Then n lines follow each containing m characters describing the board. 
Character ‘.’ means a free cell, character ‘X’ – an occupied cell, character ‘S’ – the starting cell of the queen, character ‘F’ – the cell where the queen wants to go. 
Output Format:
Print the minimum number of moves the queen has to do to reach the desired cell. Print ‘-1’ if the queen can’t reach the cell.
Constraints:
2 <= n, m <= 1000
It is guaranteed that there will be exactly one character ‘S’ and one character ‘F’ on each board.
Sample Input:
4 4

X.X.
