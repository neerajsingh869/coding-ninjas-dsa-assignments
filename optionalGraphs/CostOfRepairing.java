	/*
	 * There is city in which every citizen needs some milk in the morning, for that they should be able to reach at least some milkman of the city. There are m bi-directional roads in the city but all of them are currently un-repaired, hence not in a state of use. So, the government decided to repair some roads so that every citizen of the city is connected to at least one milkman. But, to repair those roads the government has to pay some cost and would like to minimise the cost. You have to help the government to minimise this cost. If it is not possible for a citizen to connect to any milkman, then print -1.
Note: A milkman does not need to go to some other milkman for milk as he can take milk from himself.
Input Format:
The first line contains two space -separated numbers n, m: n is the number of citizens in that city and m denotes the number of un-repaired roads 
The next line contains n space-separated integers, which are either 0 or 1, denoting for successive citizens whether they are a milkman or not. If 1, this means they are milkman otherwise not.
Then, for each of the next m lines, each line contains three space - separated integers u, v and c, denoting that there exists a un-repaired road between u and v such that the cost of repairing of road is c.
Output Format:
The output contains the cost as required. 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= min (n * (n - 1) / 2, 2 * 10^5)
1 <= u, v <= n
u != v, 1 <= c <= 10^9
Sample Input:
4 4
0 1 0 0
1 2 1
2 3 4
1 4 2
2 4 3
Sample Output:
7
