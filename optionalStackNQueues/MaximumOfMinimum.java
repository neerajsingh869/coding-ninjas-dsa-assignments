public class MaximumOfMinimum {
	
	/*
	 * You are given an array of size n. Your task is to find the maximum of the minimum of every window size in the array. Here, window size varies from 1 to n.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains the value of n (size of the array). The next line of input contains n space-separated elements of the array.
Output Format:
The only output line contains n space-separated elements denoting the maximum of minimum of every window of size k.
Constraints:
Size of the array should lie in the range [1,1000].
Sample Input:
4
10 20 30 40
Sample output:
40 30 20 10
Explanation:
First element in output indicates maximum of minimums of all windows of size 1. Minimums of windows of size 1 are {10},{20},{30},{40}. Maximum of these minimums is 40.
Second element in output indicates maximum of minimums of all windows of size 2. Minimums of windows of size 2 are {10},{20},{30}. Maximum of these minimums is 30.
Third element in output indicates maximum of minimums of all windows of size 3. Minimums of windows of size 3 are {10},{20}. Maximum of these minimums is 20.
Fourth element in output indicates maximum of minimums of all windows of size 4. Minimums of windows of size 4 are {10}. Maximum of these minimums is 10.
