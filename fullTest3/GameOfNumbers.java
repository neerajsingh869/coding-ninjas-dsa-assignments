	 * Given are two numbers X and Y. Starting from number X, we can perform two functions on the number:
Double: Multiply the number by 2, or
Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert X to Y.
Input Format:
First line contains two space separated integers X and Y.
Output Format:
Print the minimum number of operations required to get Y, starting from X.
Constraints:
1 <= X,Y <= 10^9
Sample Input 1:
2 3
Sample Output 1:
2
Explanation:
Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
Sample Input 2:
1024 1
Sample Output 2:
1023
Explanation:
Use decrement operations 1023 times.
