	/*
	 * You are given a string and then Q queries are given on that string. In each query, you will be given a starting and ending index, that will denote the starting and ending vertex of a substring of the given string, and you have to check if the given substring is freq-palindrome.
A string is called a freq-palindrome if it has the same frequency of characters in both the halves.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains a string
The second line of input contains an integer Q, representing the number of queries
Next, Q lines contain two space-separated integers representing the starting and ending vertex of a substring.
Constraints:
0 <= length of string <= 10^6
1 <= Q <= 10^4
Output Format:
For each query Q, print “Yes” if the substring is a Freq-Palindrome, otherwise print “No”
Sample Input 1:
heleltronrocop
3
1 3
0 4
6 10
Sample Output 1:
Yes
No
Yes
Explanation:
For query [ 1 3 ], substring is ‘ele’, which is a Freq-Palindrome
For query [ 0 4 ], substring is ‘helel’, which is NOT a Freq-Palindrome
For query [ 6 10 ], substring is ‘ronro’, which is a Freq-Palindrome
Sample Input 2:
