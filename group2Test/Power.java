	 * Ninja is given an easy task. He has to implement a function which calculates a^b. But there is a small difference, b is an extremely large positive number given in the form of an array.
Note: Since answers can be huge, print answer mod 1337.
It is given that b will not contain leading zeros.
Input Format:
 First line of input contains an integer a
 Second line of input contains an integer n, representing the size of the array.
 Third line of input contains an array (space separated).
Constraints:
1 <= a <= 2^31 - 1
1 <= b.length <= 3 * 10^6
0 <= b[i] <= 9
Time Limit: 1 second
Output Format:
Single line of output printing a^b
Sample Input 1:
5
2
1 5
Sample Output:
944
Explanation:
5 to the power 15 is 30517578125. Its mod with 1337 is 944.
