public class LongestSubstring {
	
	/*
	 * Given a string of lower case English letters ('a' to 'z') and a positive number K, find the length longest substring of the given string containing K distinct characters and if K is more than the number of distinct character in the input string output -1.
Note: you have output the length of the substring not the actual substring
Input Format:
First-line will contain T(number of the test case).
The first line of each test case will contain two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line of each input will contain the input string s.
Output Format:
Print the length of the longest substring or -1 if not possible to find the substring for each test case in new line
Constriants:
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 26
Sample Input:
2
5 1
amkxk
4 2
hkbp
Sample Output:
