	/*
	 * For a string of n bits x1,x2,x3,...,Xn the adjacent bit count of the string (AdjBC(x)) is given by
X1*X2 + X2*X3 + X3*X4 + ... + Xn-1 * Xn
which counts the number of times a 1 bit is adjacent to another 1 bit. For example:
AdjBC(011101101) = 3
AdjBC(111101101) = 4
AdjBC(010101010) = 0
Write a program which takes as input integers n and k and returns the number of bit strings x of n bits (out of 2‚Åø) that satisfy AdjBC(x) = k. For example, for 5 bit strings, there are 6 ways of getting AdjBC(x) = 2:
11100, 01110, 00111, 10111, 11101, 11011
Input Format:
First-line will contain T(number of the test case).
Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated integers N and K, a number of bits in the bit strings and desired adjacent bit count respectively.
Output Format:
For each test case print the answer in a new line.
As answer can be very large print your answer modulo 10^9+7.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= K <= 100
