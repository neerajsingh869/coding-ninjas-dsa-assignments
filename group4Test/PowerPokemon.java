	/*
	 * A Power Pokemon Couple is a pair of pokemons with a sum of their power levels equal to a power of two.
You are given an array power, containing the power levels of many pokemons. You can pick any two to make a power couple.
Print the number of such power pokemon couples you can form using the given array.
Note: Pokemons with different indices are considered different even if they have the same power level. Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 10^9 + 7
Input Format:
First line of input contains a integer N, representing the number of pokemons.
Second line of input contains N space separated integers representing the power levels of the pokemons
Constrains:
1 <= power.length <= 10^5
0 <= power[i] <= 22
Sample Input 1:
5
1 3 5 7 9
