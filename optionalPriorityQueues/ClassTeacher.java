	/*
	 * A teacher is studying the confidence and the smartness of her students. The confidence and the smartness are represented as an integer. The teacher wants to know the Nth smallest sum of one confidence value and one smartness value for various values of N. The confidence and the smartness value may correspond to different students.
You are given two arrays, the first array denotes the confidence value and the second array denotes the smartness value of the students. We can get a set of sums(add one element from the first array and one from the second). For each query ( denoted by an integer qi ( i = 1 to Q ) , Q denotes number of queries ) , find the qi-th element in the set of sums ( in increasing order) .
Input Format:
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers K and Q denoting the number of students and the number of queries .
The second line of input contains K space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AK denoting the confidence value of the students.
The third line of input contains K space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BK denoting the smartness of the students.
The next Q lines contains a single integer qi ( for i = 1 to Q ) , find the qi th element in the set of sums .
Output Format:
For each query of the input, output containing the answer to the query in different lines.
Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ 20000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 500
1 ≤ qi ( for i = 1 to Q ) ≤ 10000
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^18 ( for i = 1 to K )
1 ≤ Bi ≤ 10^18 ( for i = 1 to K )
Sample Input:
3 2
1 2 3
6 7 8
3
4
Sample Output:
8
9
Explanation:
The 9 elements in the set sum are:
1+6=7
1+7=8
2+6=8
1+8=9
2+7=9
3+6=9
2+8=10
3+7=10
3+8=11
