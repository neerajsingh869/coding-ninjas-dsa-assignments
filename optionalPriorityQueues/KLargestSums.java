	/*
	 * You are given a N-sized array and two integers m and k. You have to check if the product of the k largest sums contiguous subarrays is greater than m.
Input format:
The first line of input contains the size of array(N). The second line of input contains space separated elements of the array. The last line of input contains the value of k and m separated by space.
Output format:
The only line of output contains "True" (if the product of the K largest sums of contiguous subarrays is greater than M) otherwise "False"
Sample Input:
4
8 -4 -2 7
3 659
Sample Output:
False

Explanation:
The 3 largest sums contiguous subarrays are: {8}, {7} and {8, -4, -2, 7}. Product of their sums is : 8*7*9=504 and it is less than 659.
